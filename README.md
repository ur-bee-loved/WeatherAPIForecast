Trying to make some less-bland shenanigans to prettify my profile's README.md.

When trying to make my profile more appealing to recruiters, I thought about prettifying the README on my profile. In this journey, I discovered that the MARKDOWN filetype behaves differently from a normal HTML file, and I wouldn't be able to hook it up with the usual JavaScript magic we all know and love.

Once faced with this problem, I had two options: Settle with the usual template showing my preferred languages and commits, which is fine, but fitting into boxes isn’t exactly my style. The other alternative was to update this given markdown file based on another, more robust program. I chose the latter.

My efforts are now focused on handling the API calls from the weather forecast API, updating an SQLite database, and then running another script with GitHub Actions to have the MARKDOWN updated based on my location every hour of the day. I thought about this mainly because the weather seriously affects my mood. I really love rainy weather. :)

Currently, I’m having problems hooking up the main code with the SQL database. It’s my first time using SQLite. Please send help.
